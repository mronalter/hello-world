# hello-world

Hi!

My name is Mike.  I am 36 years old and making a decision to switch careers.  I am going to school for my Associates and then plan on pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science.  My plans are to become a Software Engineer and I have experience in C++, Visual Basic, and Java.  Nice to meet you!
